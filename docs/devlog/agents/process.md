### Progress

- **Model Surgery Refactoring**: The `scripts/perform_surgery.py` script has been completely rewritten. It now correctly transfers weights from a dense Qwen3 MLP to our custom sparse `TinyOnnMoE` experts by slicing and redistributing the weight tensors.
- **Unified Modular Definition**: The `tiny_onn/model.py` file has been merged into `tiny_onn/modular.py` and subsequently deleted. All model definitions now reside in a single, authoritative source file, `tiny_onn/modular.py`, adhering to the `transformers` library's modular design philosophy.
- **Static Analysis & Core Tests**: The entire `tiny_onn` module now passes `ruff` and `mypy` static analysis checks. Key unit tests, including `test_surgery.py` and `test_dynmoe.py`, are now passing, validating the correctness of the model surgery and the core MoE forward pass.

### Next Steps

- **Fix Distillation Test**: The final remaining test, `tests/test_distillation.py`, is failing due to an `AttributeError` in `train.py` when parsing the configuration file. The immediate next step is to resolve this configuration parsing issue in `train.py` to ensure the end-to-end training pipeline test passes.
